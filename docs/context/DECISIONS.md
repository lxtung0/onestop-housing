# Conversation decisions and useful reasoning

This is a distilled record of both the user's instructions and the assistant's evaluations through planning authorization on September 12, 2026. Repetition is consolidated. It is not a verbatim transcript or a claim that every assistant suggestion was accepted. `COMMISSION.md` preserves the original commission; `PROJECT.md` is the current product brief; the approved design and implementation plan will define execution.

## Requirements traced to the conversation

| ID | Origin and status | Requirement or lesson | Consequence for planning and verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C01 | User: high-stakes HackCMU project; confirmed | Competition quality and a working morning result matter more than generated code volume | Plan one complete judged experience and preserve rehearsal/submission time |
| C02 | User: original housing-search experience; confirmed | Too many major sites and too many housing options create research work the product must perform | Survey the major US portals, establish real discovery paths, reconcile duplicates, expose source coverage |
| C03 | User: whole-city clarification; confirmed | Generalize beyond CMU to other destinations and relocations | Keep destination, market, preferences, and routing parameters editable; CMU is a saved demonstration search |
| C04 | Assistant framing, explicitly endorsed | Which homes fit, what is sacrificed, what small changes unlock alternatives | Implement understandable filtering, comparisons and recomputed alternatives |
| C05 | Assistant's four questions, explicitly endorsed | Coverage, consequences, alternatives, readiness | Each part needs observable evidence; retain all four in the experience |
| C06 | User correction: less fluff; confirmed | Quantifiable, defensible facts lead; broader context remains | Prefer units, prices, travel times, source excerpts and timestamps; label qualitative observations and unknowns |
| C07 | User: lists clarification; confirmed | Browsable lists are useful | Provide a rich list with map and comparison connections; avoid forcing all inventory through chat or hiding it behind only a tiny shortlist |
| C08 | User: visual quality and reviewer; confirmed | Exceptional frontend design, detailed craft, dedicated review while user sleeps | Obtain independent design review, inspect rendered UI, and make theme/layout easy to change |
| C09 | User: CMU morning seed; confirmed | Open to a populated usable example with actual housing evidence | Collect and validate seeded records before handoff; retain exact matches, unknowns and labeled near-matches truthfully |
| C10 | User: layout and walking limit; confirmed | Houses/apartments, 2 beds, 2 baths, <=20-minute walk | Define matching semantics explicitly; calculate a pedestrian route rather than using straight-line radius or a driving route |
| C11 | User: personal rent budget; confirmed | <=$1,200/month for the user's share, rent only | Label price basis and rent split; two equal shares / $2,400 total is an editable initial assumption |
| C12 | User: utilities emphasized; confirmed | Utility inclusion is a first-class comparison variable | Record individual utilities, inclusion, exclusions, caps, known charges and unknowns prominently |
| C13 | User: Gates Hillman answer; confirmed | The destination should visibly anchor the demo | Name/pin Gates Hillman, use a verified pedestrian endpoint, show the selected property's route and time |
| C14 | User: transit and map; confirmed | Nearby stops and useful bus routes matter | Preserve route/stop identity, direction and relevant timetable evidence; bus travel cannot silently satisfy the walk constraint |
| C15 | User: contextual variables; confirmed | Shopping, errands, neighborhood preferences, amenities, perks, property type, and sourced ratings matter | Provide sourced context with explicit provenance; do not invent a single authoritative neighborhood/house quality rating |
| C16 | User: timing answer; confirmed | Move-in and lease duration are flexible | Show the available information without inventing a date requirement or current vacancy |
| C17 | User: morning review; confirmed | Ready for first viewing around 10–11 a.m. EDT September 12 | Internal readiness target 10 a.m.; event submission remains 4 p.m. EDT |
| C18 | User: cost-aware agents; confirmed | Astra coordinates; use Luna, Terra and Sol for bounded work; use available Go/Claude/Codex models | Explicit model choice, bounded assignments, limited reviewer rounds, concise handoffs, no invented token budget |
| C19 | User: requested panel; confirmed subject to actual availability | Fable 5.1 independent review, dedicated frontend review, backend reliability review | Validate exact model IDs and authenticated terminal responses; report substitutions or unavailable models honestly |
| C20 | User: uninterrupted overnight work; confirmed | Continue within agreed scope and actual permissions; avoid repeated approval or verification loops | Set finite checkpoints, time-bound failed approaches, establish fallbacks and one repair owner, preserve a known-good candidate |
| C21 | User: planning first; confirmed | Record the conversation's value and make implementation straightforward | Produce a spec, contracts, file ownership, task dependencies and concrete acceptance checks before final go |
| C22 | Prior intel / user preference carried forward | Lean coordination, people choose tasks, no permanent human component roles | Use one canonical brief/contract and existing tracker; no process-only services or CI |

## Assistant findings retained as evidence or recommendations

1. **Competitive overlap is real.** Zillow advertises natural-language rental search and AI tradeoff discussions; Apartments.com offers conversational rental search; Apartment List offers matching around must-haves/nice-to-haves. Cross-platform aggregation also has precedent. The proposed experience requires a demonstrated advantage; it is not established as globally novel. Sources: [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/news/zillow-ai-mode-will-change-how-renters-decide-not-just-how-they-search/), [Apartments.com](https://www.apartments.com/grow/learning-center/apartments-ai-launch), [Apartment List](https://www.apartmentlist.com/), [Rentvoy developer case study](https://www.agency7.ca/case-studies/rentvoy).
2. **Optimization is the recommended main track.** Explicit constraints, comparisons and changed-input results provide a natural demonstration. Final track selection remains a product decision; no official scoring weights or win probability are known.
3. **Data acquisition is a hard dependency.** Readable research pages are not proof of a supported application connector. Source access, freshness, units, price bases and utility semantics need actual checks. [Zillow terms](https://www.zillow.com/corporate/terms-of-use/) and [Apartments.com terms](https://www.apartments.com/grow/about/terms-of-service) restrict automated collection; access strategy cannot be assumed from visibility.
4. **Synthetic data has a limited role.** It can test computation and error paths when labeled. It cannot fulfill the user's request for an actually sourced CMU housing seed or validate a live-coverage claim. The inventory must not be invented to guarantee an attractive count of matches.
5. **The LLM should work on evidence.** It can interpret preferences and messy listing descriptions and explain results. It should not invent prices, utilities, availability, addresses, reviews or calibrated confidence; arithmetic and hard-constraint checks should be reproducible.
6. **Meaningful alternatives beat opaque scoring.** Show distinct compromises and numerical changes where supported. Unknown costs or route data remain unresolved, rather than being treated as favorable zeros.
7. **Preserve research during preference changes.** Re-evaluate prior records when applicable, retain favorites/comparison state, and discover further records when a changed destination or wider search requires it. This is an accepted direction to make precise in the spec.
8. **A useful endpoint is an actionable shortlist.** The user endorsed readiness alongside broad discovery, but explicitly still wants lists of options. The shortlist complements the inventory; it must not erase it.
9. **Plan depth needs a stopping condition.** Enough detail to resolve consequential interfaces, risks and acceptance is valuable. Repeated reviewer agreement, speculative architecture, and long verification loops are not substitutes for progress.
10. **The prior bus project is a lesson, not active scope.** Its main concerns were incumbent overlap and uncertain occupancy data. Old contracts, stacks, queues and branches do not transfer. One failed source does not disprove all possible access; one successful response does not prove a working product.

## Superseded interpretations

- “Reject a generic list” must not become “the user does not want lists.” They explicitly do.
- “CMU seed” must not become “the product is only for CMU.” The broader city/destination goal remains.
- “$1,200 budget” must not become a $1,200 whole-home cap. It is the user's share of rent.
- Flexible timing must not become a fabricated move-in date or required one-year lease.
- “Grounded and quantifiable” must not remove neighborhood context, shopping, amenities, perks or qualitative evidence.
- “Simple backend” expresses the reliability goal; it does not establish that source reconciliation and routing are trivial.
- “Quality over time” does not reset the event clock or permit sacrificing the entire working demo for indefinite planning.
- Owning subscriptions does not prove CLI login, exact model availability, application API access, or an unattended process.

## Planning outputs and evidence

The plan must map C01–C22 to implementation tasks or explicit scope decisions, with source/runtime evidence linked. Unknowns must become an explicit experiment, fallback or limitation rather than a hidden assumption. The lead owns reconciliation of reviewer findings and shared interfaces. Reviewer reports remain supporting evidence, not competing product specifications.

## Completed planning and validation

- The original commission and later user refinements are preserved in [COMMISSION.md](COMMISSION.md) and [USER-REFINEMENTS.md](USER-REFINEMENTS.md). This file captures the useful reasoning, decisions and their status; it is not a reconstructed verbatim assistant transcript.
- Codex/Astra, OpenCode Go/Luna and Claude/Fable 5.1 each returned a successful terminal response. Fable's design review and OpenCode Go/glm-5.3's backend review completed. See [runtime evidence](../research/runtime-validation.md).
- The user explicitly approved both external review packets. The earlier automatic export rejection was resolved; no approval for those packets is pending.
- A real CLI discovery/fetch probe succeeded, but independent checking found a cross-unit availability-date error. Discovery invocation is established; correct ingestion still requires implementation and the scope/evidence gate. This finding is retained as a required regression test.
- Initial household composition is still an assumption: two equal shares, visibly editable. The demo interprets 2 bathrooms as a minimum advertised count and labels the control `2 beds · 2+ baths`; it does not invent full/half decompositions.
- Unknown utilities affect readiness and total-cost completeness, not the default rent-only hard filter. Flexible timing is retained as display/readiness data; advanced date/lease filters are outside the morning version.
- The exact Gates point is an OSM mapped entrance. The app must not claim physical or named-Forbes-entrance verification that was not obtained.
- The [design](../superpowers/specs/2026-09-12-housing-design.md), [contracts](../CONTRACTS.md) and [implementation plan](../superpowers/plans/2026-09-12-housing.md) define the reviewable build. [Review resolutions](../reviews/RESOLUTIONS.md) record accepted/corrected recommendations. Final build go remains the user's next phase.
- After reviewing plan status, the user explicitly reaffirmed the next phase's scope: build the full working application, pull fresh real data from several selected housing sites for the demo, and iteratively develop/review a sleek modern frontend. Frontend quality is roughly half the hackathon battle and is a required outcome alongside live acquisition. This strengthens C08/C09 and the existing rendered-review checkpoints; it does not imply that every portal is a working connector or change the phase gate.

## Build authorization and revised target

The user commissioned the autonomous full build, public-source research, iteration, and Fable/OpenCode Go reviews at the coordinator's discretion. The viewing target is approximately 11 a.m. EDT September 12, give or take; do not sacrifice important work or quality to an exact deadline. This supersedes the earlier 10 a.m. target and the pending-go status. See `../BUILD-STATUS.md`.

## Post-handoff account request

The user requested a rapid Auth0/account addition, prioritizing speed and accuracy over extensive production hardening. They asked whether it needs an application database or MongoDB, the likely effort, and whether it can be completed in one focused pass. Asked whether they already have an Auth0 account/tenant, they answered “Not sure.” The dashboard was opened for their sign-in or registration; no password or tenant credentials were provided.

The assistant's recommendation is Auth0 Universal Login integrated into the existing Express server, with email/password accounts, a session, logout and a compact account menu. Auth0 supplies the user store; an application database is optional and serves a different purpose: synchronizing saved housing work across devices. Current saved searches live in browser storage and need separate account namespaces. The proposed database-free scope, setup, implementation and verification are recorded in [the Auth0 plan](../superpowers/plans/2026-09-12-auth0.md). This is a plan, not an implemented authentication feature or a user decision against future database-backed saved work.
