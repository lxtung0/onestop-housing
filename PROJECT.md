# Housing project: guiding brief

Project name: **OneStop**. The user confirmed consolidating the name change with the account and Grok branches on main. The name emphasizes bringing housing research into one place.

This is the canonical product direction, established with the user on September 12, 2026. It precedes the detailed design, implementation plan, and build. Read it alongside `hackcmu-intel/AGENT_BRIEF.md`. The intelligence pack supplies competition context; this file supplies the replacement project's purpose.

## Confirmed core

> Across these sources, which places actually fit my life, what am I sacrificing, and what small change would unlock better options?

The user explicitly endorsed that question and added an equally important requirement: carry the burden of searching a fragmented housing market. A person faces many sites, many homes, many interacting life preferences, and changing priorities. Each change can force them to repeat the research. The product must make that whole decision manageable.

The intended scope is city-wide housing discovery across major sources, adaptable to someone relocating for a job, school, or another life change. The user has selected a fully seeded CMU search for the initial demonstration, with the criteria below. The general product remains adaptable to other destinations and whole-city searches. Current working source adapters and access gaps are documented in `docs/reports/coverage-audit.md`. Gathering relevant options remains part of the product's job.

The system should do the gathering, reconciliation, comparison, and reconsideration needed to present useful options. The renter retains control of priorities and the final decision.

## Accepted decision questions

The user endorsed these four parts of the experience and explicitly wants all four retained. They must be grounded in observable facts and computations:

| Part | What the user should learn | Evidence the product must expose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Coverage | Where we looked, what we found, and where the search remains incomplete | Sources attempted and successfully searched, retrieval dates, distinct homes found, duplicates reconciled, and known gaps; no unsupported percentage of the entire market |
| Consequences | How each home affects commute, expenses, errands, and stated priorities | Sourced listing details, routed journeys, itemized known costs, nearby destinations, and explicitly labeled estimates or unknowns |
| Alternatives | What a changed requirement unlocks and what the user gains or sacrifices | Recomputed candidates with exact changes to rent, travel time, layout, or other relevant criteria; original requirements remain visible |
| Readiness | Which homes warrant further attention and what could change that decision | Explicit fit reasons, original listing links, availability evidence, and consequential questions to verify before investigating or touring |

The user wants solid, quantifiable, defensible results. Qualitative context and amenities still belong in the product, with their evidence and limitations visible. An unspecified quality score or persuasive summary cannot substitute for those facts.

The product promise is:

> Search across the housing market, understand what each realistic option means for my daily life, and help me reach a shortlist I can act on. Show why those options fit, what I would trade away, what remains uncertain, and what changes would unlock alternatives.

## Requested CMU demonstration

The user wants to wake up to a populated version they can personally review, rather than having to collect listings or configure the initial search. The implemented application contains a versioned, audited CMU seed collected from real public pages. `docs/BUILD-STATUS.md` records acceptance and handoff status.

| Criterion | Current requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Location | Carnegie Mellon University area in Pittsburgh |
| Walking limit | User-confirmed destination: Gates Hillman at CMU. Within a 20-minute computed walking route to the mapped entrance at 40.4440338, -79.9445593 (OSM node 1704796692). The exact point has map evidence; physical verification and a named Forbes-entrance identity have not been established |
| Layout | 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms; planned visible interpretation is exactly 2 beds and at least 2 advertised baths, labeled `2 beds · 2+ baths`. Preserve full/half-bath counts where supplied rather than inventing a decomposition |
| Property types | Houses or apartments |
| Rent budget | User-confirmed maximum of $1,200 per month for their personal share, rent only. Editable demo assumption: two people splitting rent equally, giving a $2,400 whole-home rent ceiling. The roommate count and split are assumptions, not user-confirmed household facts |
| Utilities | Explicitly emphasize which utilities are included in advertised rent, separately charged, partly covered, or unknown |
| Map | Map candidates and a clearly labeled Gates Hillman destination pin. Selecting a candidate should show its walking route to Gates Hillman when available, with the source and routing assumptions inspectable |
| Transit | Consider relevant bus routes and stops, including whether they serve the intended destination and direction; a bus alternative does not silently override the walking limit |
| Timing | User confirmed flexible move-in date and lease duration. Still show stated availability and lease terms, and flag missing or stale information |
| Review experience | A populated, browsable list of options, connected map, comparisons, editable criteria, and visible sources and uncertainties |
| Morning review | User revised the target to approximately 11 a.m. EDT on September 12, 2026 (15:00 UTC), give or take; preserve important quality work rather than rushing to an exact cutoff |

Seed the eventual demo with sourced housing records and provenance, and accurately label when they were checked. A saved snapshot is not proof of current vacancy. If the data contains no exact matches, report that result and show separately identified near-matches with their specific deviations. Do not fabricate qualifying homes, assume unknown fields pass, or silently relax the request to fill the screen. The acceptance target concerns a usable populated search and truthful results, not a guaranteed number of exact matches.

The user explicitly wants Gates Hillman visible in the demo to make the location-specific value tangible. Name it in the saved search and listing walking-time labels, keep its destination pin distinct on the map, and connect a selected home's route to that pin. The destination must be used by the actual walking calculation, not added only as decorative copy. Preserve an editable destination for searches beyond this seed.

## Rent, fees, and utilities

- Preserve whether a quoted rent is for an entire unit, a room, or one person's share. Do not compare different price bases as equivalent. A per-person allocation needs an explicit roommate count and split assumption.
- Keep base rent, mandatory recurring fees, one-time charges, and any advertised concession separate. Identify the lease conditions behind a concession or effective-rent figure.
- The requested $1,200 filter applies to the user's monthly share of rent only. Under the explicitly labeled initial assumption of two equal shares, the whole-home rent limit is $2,400. Keep roommate count and allocation editable, and label computed shares separately from a landlord's per-room quote. Additional expenses must remain prominent even when they do not change the rent filter.
- Track electricity, gas, water/sewer, trash, internet, and other listed utility charges individually where the source provides details. Preserve caps, allowances, shared billing, and partial coverage when stated.
- For each utility, keep the listing's evidence and its status: included, separately charged, partly covered, or not stated. Record a charge or estimate only with its basis. Missing cost is not zero.
- Present known recurring costs and unresolved additional costs clearly. Only describe a total as complete when the required components are known. Estimates must be visibly separate from quoted charges.
- Highlight utility inclusion and uncertainty in the list and comparison experience; it must not be buried in listing prose or available only through chat.

## Obligations derived from that purpose

These guide the next design; they are not a finalized feature list or implementation contract.

1. **Carry the search burden.** Gather and reconcile options from supported sources. Make coverage and freshness inspectable. Distinguish the sources surveyed from those successfully searched, and listings collected from distinct available homes. Broad coverage is a substantive promise to prove.
2. **Make daily life legible.** Connect housing to the user's destinations, travel modes, budget, timing, and preferred nearby activities or amenities. A useful comparison concerns the consequences of living there. Neighborhood fit should use the renter's stated preferences and sourced observations; uncertain information stays uncertain.
3. **Preserve the meaning of preferences.** Distinguish firm requirements from flexible preferences and exploratory changes. Explain what a proposed compromise changes. Never silently relax a requirement or treat an unknown as a confirmed match.
4. **Expose defensible alternatives.** Show why a home is worth considering, what it gives up, and what other option represents a different compromise. Any ranking or comparison must follow inspectable inputs and rules. An unexplained score cannot carry the decision.
5. **Support reconsideration without restarting.** Preference changes should reuse the research already performed where it remains applicable, revisit relevant excluded options, and identify when the change requires more discovery. Preserve the user's shortlist and comparison context.
6. **Make trust inspectable.** Keep source evidence, observation dates, conflicting claims, and missing information attached to the facts used in recommendations. Preserve distinctions between buildings, units, listings, advertised prices, fees, concessions, and lease conditions. The LLM may interpret and explain evidence; its fluency does not establish facts or validate a recommendation.
7. **Lead toward action.** A useful endpoint is a small set of homes worth investigating or touring, with the consequential unanswered questions visible. The product should help the user recognize progress toward that endpoint.

## Frontend direction

The intended feeling is calm, clarity, and control after an overwhelming search. Visual craft is a core product requirement. Typography, color, spacing, imagery, motion, and information hierarchy should support understanding housing choices and their consequences.

The user explicitly likes seeing lists of options. Provide an effective browsable list with meaningful details, sorting, comparison, and map connections. Avoid hiding the inventory behind a chat or an artificially tiny shortlist. The earlier objection concerned generic visual execution and undifferentiated results, not lists themselves.

Lead with useful facts and understandable tradeoffs. Keep preferences easy to adjust and comparisons stable enough to follow. Reveal deeper evidence when it helps the current decision. Every displayed number, badge, explanation, and animation should have a clear job. Strong typography, color, spacing, and layout should make evidence easier to compare.

Retain the broader context the user values: shopping and errands, useful transit, preferred nearby amenities, property type and features, perks, and sourced review information where available. Describe neighborhood fit through relevant observations and the user's preferences. Give quantitative information its units and qualitative information its source; do not remove either category merely to simplify the story.

The reviewable design now specifies an aligned list/map workspace, visible utility evidence, Plex Sans/Mono typography and editable presentation tokens. It incorporates Fable's independent review; see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-12-housing-design.md`. It remains easy to revise without changing the decision logic.

The user reaffirmed before the build that frontend quality is roughly half the hackathon battle. The next phase must deliver the full working application, actual fresh retrieval from several selected housing sites for the demonstration, and a sleek modern frontend developed through rendered iterations and independent review. Visual quality is a release requirement alongside functional/data correctness. Inspect actual browser output and revise it with Fable and the frontend worker before handoff; a first generated pass does not satisfy that expectation. Freshly retrieved records retain source URLs and observation times, while the saved snapshot keeps the presentation reliable between refreshes. Do not describe unsupported sources as live integrations.

## Backend direction

The backend carries the same product obligations: reliable collection, reconciliation, evidence preservation, correct preference handling, reproducible comparisons, and useful recovery when a source fails. These are essential engineering work. Changing the interface cannot compensate for unreliable facts or opaque decisions.

Data access is the first major feasibility question. A list of desired websites is not proof of working coverage. The eventual plan must establish actual access paths and make any limitations explicit while preserving useful progress.

## Competition and decision discipline

The user reaffirmed after viewing the demo that the renter's problem must remain the anchor and asked how this differs from Zillow. The core problem is the repeated manual work of finding options across sources, reconciling inconsistent claims, checking everyday consequences, and revisiting the whole comparison when a requirement changes. The working name is secondary to removing that work.

Competitive claims were rechecked on September 12, 2026. Zillow documents [commute and points-of-interest search](https://www.zillow.com/news/zillows-ai-powered-home-search-gets-smarter-with-new-natural-language-features/), [total monthly pricing and fee calculators](https://www.zillow.com/learn/rental-pricing-transparency/), and [AI-assisted comparisons, tradeoffs and remembered preferences](https://www.zillow.com/news/zillow-debuts-ai-mode/). The March AI-mode announcement describes a limited beta; this documentation review does not establish its present availability for every account. Maps, filters, AI, utility information and comparisons alone do not establish our differentiation.

The strongest proposed position is a renter's research workspace spanning supported independent sources: maintain comparable offer records, apply the same personal-budget and destination rules, retain evidence and unknowns, compute explicit reversible compromises, and identify consequential questions before a tour. The current demo proves parts of this workflow with three directly imported housing organizations and a bounded 49-record seed. It has not proved superior market coverage, exclusive inventory, or reduced research time compared with Zillow. A zero-match snapshot must never be described as proof that the city has no matches.

The next competitive proof should compare the same renter task against a Zillow-plus-maps/manual-notes workflow: relevant distinct options found, time to a reasoned shortlist, manual lookups required, material cost/availability mistakes, and work needed after changing a requirement. These are evaluation criteria, not measured improvements or an automatic authorization to expand the implementation. Every feature should help find an overlooked option, make a consequence comparable, expose a meaningful compromise, resolve an important uncertainty, or avoid repeating research.

Optimization is the current recommendation for main-track fit, not yet a final selection. The demonstration should make the research burden, a useful comparison, and the consequence of changing a preference visible within the event's three-minute limit.

LLM search, rental matching, aggregation, and tradeoff explanations have existing competitors. This direction is a hypothesis for a better experience, not evidence of global novelty. Its advantage must be demonstrated against a relevant existing workflow.

For every proposed feature or technical choice, ask: How does this help the renter discover a relevant option, understand a life consequence, explore a meaningful compromise, trust the evidence, or take the next step? State the benefit and its proof before expanding scope.

## Current phase

The user authorized the full build and autonomous overnight research, implementation, iteration and Fable/OpenCode Go reviews. The current target is approximately 11 a.m. EDT September 12 (15:00 UTC), give or take, with quality and important work prioritized over an exact cutoff. This supersedes earlier 10 a.m. planning targets. Follow `docs/BUILD-STATUS.md`, the design, contracts and implementation plan. Preserve real source evidence, frontend quality and the complete decision loop.

Implementation handoff: the full application is integrated into `main` and verified. Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173`; see `docs/verification.md` for actual acceptance results, source scope, rendered review evidence and practical limits.
