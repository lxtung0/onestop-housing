# OneStop — housing research, in one place

OneStop helps a renter search across fragmented housing sources, compare the
daily consequences of each home, and see which small compromise unlocks another
option. The seeded demonstration is a Pittsburgh search around Carnegie Mellon.

Deployment and server-only Grok configuration are documented in
[the deployment runbook](docs/deployment.md).

## Run the demo

Requirements: Node.js 22.12 or newer.

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
npm start
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:4173](http://127.0.0.1:4173). The production server
serves the built frontend and API on port 4173. Stop it with `Ctrl-C`.

The portable seed is already in `data/seed/cmu.json`. To restore it as the
current snapshot after a research run:

```sh
npm run demo:reset
```

That command keeps newer immutable snapshots in `data/snapshots/`. The
browser's **Reset demo** control restores the seeded criteria and clears the
browser's criteria, comparison, and shortlist state.

For development, use `npm run dev`; Vite and the API use separate local
processes, with the API on `http://127.0.0.1:4318`.

Copy `.env.example` to the ignored `.env.local` for optional local configuration.
`XAI_API_KEY` enables **Ask for anything**, which uses Grok to highlight options
for a specific preference while preserving the original requirements and their
exact deviations. Never prefix this key with `VITE_` or commit it. Auth0 account
code is integrated but requires a configured tenant; guest research works without it.

## Seeded search

The starting search asks for 2 bedrooms, at least 2 advertised bathrooms, a
maximum personal rent of `$1,200`, two equal shares as an editable assumption,
and a computed walk of at most 20 minutes to the mapped Gates Hillman entrance.
The seed contains 49 sourced options from three imported organizations, 24
usable foot routes, 30 placed records, 30 homes with transit context, and 21
with nearby essentials. It records 20 major or local registered source
surfaces; only the three imported organizations are represented as direct
housing captures.

The central result is allowed to be empty: the current seed has zero exact
matches. The Alternatives panel shows the observed tradeoffs, including
raising the personal cap by `$7.50` for Webster Hall B2 at `$2,415` whole-home
rent, allowing one bathroom for Schenley House at `$1,995`, or allowing the
longer walk to 6350 Forward at `$1,995`. Rent basis, utility inclusion, fees,
availability, and source timestamps remain separate facts. Unknown does not
mean zero, and a saved observation does not confirm current vacancy.
